      </div>
      <div class="heroBlurb">
        <p>Pokemon, which launched in 1996, has sold more than 380 million video games and recorded over one billion Pokémon GO downloads since 2016, and these days the Pokemon trading card market has also exploded again with some original cards from the '90s being auctioned off for hundreds of thousands of dollars. In the last six years, Pokémon has also drastically increased its fashion presence and partnered with some incredible fashion brands and retailers across the world. Pokémon’s allure to the fashion industry stems from its broad global appeal, the characters are loved across all ages and demographics; fashion brands are embracing the gaming phenomenon with innovative and fun designs. This website will highlight some of the fashion brand collaborations Pokemon has had over the past few years.</p>

          In January 2020, Adidas collaborated with Pokemon to launch a unique new line inspired by the game’s iconic Pokemon and retro 8-bit graphics. Featuring both adult and youth styles, the collaboration sees classic Adidas tracksuits, t-shirts, pants, shorts, and three types of shoes given a classic gaming refresh. Much of the design aesthetic of the collection is inspired by classic lo-fi 8-bit graphics, reminiscent of Pokemon as they were seen when the first games launched; the collection sees the game’s array of effects, using patterns of pixels to create colors, gradients, and textures, combined with some of Adidas’s most celebrated retro staples for fans who want to take their love of the game to the next level. Colin Palmer, VP of Marketing at The Pokemon Company International, stated that “This collaboration between Pokémon and Adidas sees two of the world’s biggest brands combine to create a unique clothing capsule for Pokémon Trainers. Together, we’ve reimagined timeless Adidas staples, giving them a classic but distinctly Pokémon refresh to create a stylish new line that will enable fans to look the part while leveling-up their love of Pokémon games.”

          In September 2022, Balmain partnered with Pokemon to release a special, limited-edition collection. Though an unexpected pairing, both Balmain and Pokemon share an uncommonly bold and adventurous outlook and sets themselves apart by their constant evolution and embrace of new technologies, while always buzzing with uniquely addictive energy and color. Olivier Rousteing, creative director of Balmain, shared that “Pokemon’s bright pop aesthetic and captivating creatures have always appealed to me,” and that “Today, they make me think of an earlier, simpler time, when we all shared a rosy vision of all the positive changes that we were certain that digital innovations would make possible. And that’s a key reason why I’m so happy to partner with Pokémon on this collection — because, right now, we could all use a reminder of those past moments of hope and optimism.” In the collection, sweats, jackets, and oversized tops and bottoms cleverly channel the bold graphic treatment that one immediately recognizes as Pokémon — and many of the accessories are inventive hybrids of Balmain’s signature bags and Pokémon illustrations.

          The North Face x Gucci collection made its debut in Pokemon GO in January 2021 and for a limited time, avatar items based on T-shirts, hats, and backpacks from the collection were available at over 100 PokeStops around the world, located at Gucci Pins, which are pop-up shops in select parks and stores. When the Gucci x The North Face collaboration was announced in 2020, it sent waves through the fashion world. Those waves became bigger when Gucci shared that Niantic’s Pokémon GO app would play host to the collaboration and then dropped a new documentary. As Pokemon GO had been named one of Apple’s Best of 2020 Apps and according to Forbes made $2 billion in 2020, Gucci’s creative director Alessandro Michele decided to foray into the world of fashion gaming. The pandemic had forced many brands to come up with new creative ways to connect with audiences, following the prolonged closures of retail stores.

          Shortly after teaming up with Mishka for a googly-eyed BE@RBRICK, Medicom Toy returned in February 2022, this time calling in Pokémon to recreate one of Pokemon’s most iconic creatures, a bright yellow Pikachu figure. The collectible toy embraces all the bold details characteristic of Pikachu and comes in sizes of 400% and 100%. Starting at the top, the piece sees black lines at the edge of its ears. Its face boasts round black eyes with white pupils, a tiny black dot at the tip of its small nose, and a squiggly smiling expression. Finishing off the character’s facial profile, two bold red circles are placed at the cheeks. Everything below the head has been kept clean, wrapping the lively yellow palette all throughout the rest of the body. The Bearbrick Pikachu Figure, which is available on the Pokémon Center website, features "a cheerful winking face and an adorably chubby belly." The toy has multiple points of articulation, including the legs, wrists, arms, waist, and head, which allows owners to "create fun poses and scenes."
